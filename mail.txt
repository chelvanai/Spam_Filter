Hi there,  

We are halfway through our API lifecycle series and the next session , " Using the Open API Specification Across the SDLC   "   is tomorrow, July 24th! We will be discussing the tactical journey of standardizing around Open API and how to scale and enforce design practices across teams in your organization.

In the past two sessions we covered upgrading from open source to pro tooling and exploring design-first vs code-first approaches to API development.  Don't worry if you missed either of these sessions, just sign-up and we will send you a recording of all the past & upcoming sessions!

There are 2 more sessions left in the series, sign up now to not miss out!    Here is an overview of remaining topics we will be discussing:   

    July 24th: Using the Open API Specification Across the SDLC
    July 31st: Showcasing Teams that Have Put SmartBear Tools into Action
